I have been accepted by <a href="http://xmms2.org">xmms2</a> as a student for GSoC this year!

My proposal is to implement <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/guilherme_pg/14003">Service Clients</a>: basically, clients that can offer functionalities to other clients by exposing methods for remote calls.
This is actually a long-standing idea, and there's even an incomplete
implementation already.

It will be very interesting to see all sorts of crazy services popping up after I'm done with my project...

Stay tuned!
