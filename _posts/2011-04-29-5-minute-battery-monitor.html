<p>
I was left with no AC adapter for my notebook for a few hours on Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
Having no battery monitor installed and being unable to install one, I was clueless about how much battery life I still had.
So I did the best I could at the time: <del>shut down the notebook</del> hacked together a very simple battery monitor by parsing the contents of <code>/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state</code> and <code>/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info</code>.
</p>

<p>
So here it is, too pointless for Github, and too useful for oblivion:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
{% include snippets/battery.sh %}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
A fun time-waster would be to try to convert it into a pure awk script, but that's going to have to wait.
