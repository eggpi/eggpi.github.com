<p>
I'm Guilherme P. Gon√ßalves, a 23 years old computer engineer, <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ggp/">Mozillian</a> and general free software enthusiast.
</p>

<p>
I started this blog mainly as a way to document my work during the 2011 Google Summer of Code, but decided to keep it as a developer's blog ever since.
I'll write here about my projects and cool findings, always trying to bring a new and instructive view on interesting topics I happen to run into at the time.

For a few of my projects, feel free to look at my <a href="https://github.com/guilherme-pg">GitHub page.</a>
